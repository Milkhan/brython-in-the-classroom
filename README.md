---------

[pyschool](http://pyschool.net) is a user friendly web based python code editor.

pyschool's primary objective is to create an education tool that reduces
the technological barriers necessary to bring python to the classroom.

pyschool will ALWAYS be free for educators and students, thus reducing another
barrier, the financial barrier.

pyschool is powered by [brython](http://brython.info), a python compiler 
written in javascript and developed for a web browser environment.
