<h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>
<p>
<strong>Q. Are educators and students the only ones allowed to use PySchool.net?</strong>
<br>
A. Everyone can use PySchool.net.  If you are interesting in learning more
   about Python you are welcome to use the site, free of charge.
<p>
<strong>Q. Is there a cost for PySchool.net?</strong>
<br>
A. Users will never be asked to pay for PySchool.net.  Our goal is to minimize
   barriers for learning computer science.  Asking for payment from users
   goes against our goals.
<p>
<strong>Q. There is no free lunch. Who pays for the site and developed resources?</strong>
<br>
A. Through fund raising efforts, such as our KickStarter campaign,
   we are raising funds to support the site as well as programming staff, to
   support the site, and add new features, etc.
<p>
<strong>Q. You say the site is free forever.  How can you make such claims?</strong>
<br>
A. You make a good point.  As they say, there are only two things guaranteed in life,
   death and taxes. Rightly, so. According to

   unless there is a great economic catastrophe of some type (and with a little
   financial discipline), the fund should always contain sufficient funds.
   If for some reason, funds are depleted below an acceptable amount, there
   are some things that can be done to resolve the issue.  One, additional
   donations, funds, etc can help bring the fund to a healthy amount, second,
   disbursement amounts can temporarily be reduced until the fund is brought
   back to healthy levels.
   <p>
   For those interested in more details, a disbursement of 3% per year 
   (approx. $60,000) will be authorized by the PySchool.net organization for 
   maintenance, adding new features to the website, adding tutorials, and the
   day to day operations of PySchool.net

<strong>Q. How do you execute Python code in a browser enviroment?</strong>

American computering machines (ACM) blogger Philip Guo looked at 
introductionary computer science courses at top ranked US departments.
Specifically eight of the top 10 CS departments (80%) and 27 of the top 39 (69%) teach Python in introductionary CS0 or CS 1 courses.
